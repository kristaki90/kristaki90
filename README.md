ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Mysten LabsğŸ’§ as a Software Engineer ğŸ’»

Due to my involvement in various demanding dynamic web apps, I consider myself a full-stack developer, usually dealing with Angular in the frontend, while in the backend I am confident with both Spring Java and Laravel PHP frameworks, respectively.

 In the past, I used to be a Game Developer and junior Graphics Designer working with CryEngine, Unity3D, Adobe Flash & ActionScript for game development and Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects and GoAnimate to create marketing and other UI material.
